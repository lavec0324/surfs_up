## Overview of the Analysis

Purpose of this analysis was to extract data from a database that captures temperaturs for Oahu for purposes of analyzing weather conditions for the months of June and December.  This will allow us to provide information valuable to our investor W. Avy to determine if the surf shop and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results

From the tables below we can see summary statistics as follows:

#### June Temperature Summary:

#### December Temperature Summary:

We can observe the following three differences:

* The average temperature are relatively consitent between the two months about 4 degrees cooler in December.
* The minimum temperature for Decmber is shown as 56 degrees F in December while in June it is 64 degrees F.
* Observations observed for the month of December are over 183 less than in June which could cause a less accurate result in temperature statistics for the month of December.

Additionally, from our histograms we can see a much high occurence of temperatures in the 75 degree bands as opposed to the higher occurrence in the 70 degree bands in December:

## Summary

What we can determine from this data that while there are variations in temperature between the months there are still significantly warm temperatures during the month of December.  This may give W. Avy the assurance that the business can survive all year round.

Additional queries to gather more data might be:

* The number of stations that are taking the readings.
* The elevation of those stations and how they may impact the temperature on those readings.
* The amount of rain for the months could also be significant as that may deter surfing or folks going out to enjoy ice cream.
