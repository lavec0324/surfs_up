## Overview of the Analysis

Purpose of this project was to analyze several sources of employee data from Pewlett-Hackard and determine as they look toward to succession planning.  We will be looking at the number of retiring employees by their title and see where potential gaps exist and where that may be filled by looking at mentorship opportunities within the company.  This may help the company determine if the voids that are left by retiring employees can be filled by training within the company.

## Results

From the tables below we can see:

* PH has a disproportionate population of senior personnel retiring which includes engineers and staff
* There is a very small population of managers retiring
* Overall numbers of mentors is small relative to the retiring staff which would be an issue as even with one person have several mentorees they would still not be able to cover the retiring population
* That disproportion gets even greater when looking at the senior engineers, where potential mentors are outnumbered by retirees by over 150 to 1

## Summary

Specifically answering two questions asked:

* How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
  * 72,458 roles will need to be filled if all eligible retirees are to be replaced
* Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
  * No, based on the current criteria, the number of mentors are far overshadowed by the number of retiring employees.

Additional queries could include:

* Count of number of employees in the retirement table to simplify summing up the number of employees eligible for retirement.
* Increase the date ranges of the mentors to expand the population of mentors.
* Group by counts on mentors (already included but not originally requested)
* Could also create queries to see what other roles were performed by employees, not just the current role, to see if mentorship can be expanded where gaps exist.
